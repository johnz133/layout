			</h1>
			<a href="http://dcurt.is/nick-denton-crisis-letter"><p>Nick Denton runs Gawker Media, one of the last bastions of truly independent online media in the world. And despite healthy traffic growth during the past year, Denton thinks 2014 was a year of vague regression for Gawker: not true growth, but rather a slow devolution of voice and rigor. Denton wants to see Gawker as the leader of truth and honesty in online media, but his competition is <em>Top Ten Nip Slips</em> from Buzzfeed. When your product is ostensibly intellectual, how do you compete with hits of cocaine? Gawker finds itself today in a tough place, where the challenges are new and unusual. </p> <p>The letter below, which Denton sent to all Gawker Media employees today, faintly reminds me of the ones sent by Jeff Katzenberg to Disney in 1991 and John Walker to Autodesk in 1983. Every once in a while, you have shake things up. And the announcement has to be as inspiring as the shakeup itself....</p></a>

			<a href="http://dcurt.is/amazon-has-no-taste"><p>I used to give Amazon&#39;s consumer hardware strategy the benefit of the doubt. I liked the original e-ink Kindles, even though they were made out of cheap plastic. I kind of understood the first Kindle Fire tablet, even though it was a piece of junk. But as Amazon has released more and more pieces of junk over the past couple of years, I&#39;ve lost faith. The Fire Phone, for example, is not just bad; it&#39;s so terrible that it&#39;s dishonest of Amazon to sell it to anyone. There are zero people on Earth who would be better off owning a Fire Phone instead of an Android phone. I&#39;m not exaggerating-go find one to play with, and you&#39;ll understand. The hardware is abysmal and the software is embarrassing. You would have to be delusional as a manager to launch it and tell people that it is a well-made phone. What does that say about Amazon&#39;s consumer-side brand and strategy?</p> <p>It&#39;s extremely hard for...</p></a><p><a href="http://dcurt.is/amazon-has-no-taste" class="button">Continue reading...</a></p>

			<h1><a href="http://dcurt.is/privacy-vs-user-experience">Privacy vs. User Experience</a></h1>
			<a href="//dcurt.is/privacy-vs-user-experience"><p>Apple is going to realize very soon that it has made a grave mistake by positioning itself as a bastion of privacy against Google, the evil invader of everyone&#39;s secrets. The truth is that collecting information about people allows you to make significantly better products, and the more information you collect, the better products you can build. Apple can barely sync iMessage across devices because it uses an encryption system that prevents it from being able to read the actual messages. Google knows where I am right now, where I need to be for my meeting in an hour, what the traffic is like, and whether I usually take public transportation, a taxi, or drive myself. Using that information, it can tell me exactly when to leave. This isn&#39;t science fiction; it&#39;s actually happening. And Apple&#39;s hardline stance on privacy is going to leave it in Google&#39;s dust.</p> <p>In a recent public letter...</p></a>
